Mission: Sharing granular location outside of a global context using local map (e.g. within a festival, sporting event, in an online game, etc)

---
## Todo:  

- <del>Import custom image for map from gallery or URL
-Adding custom location marker overlay  
  - <del>scaling / positioning markers based on map tile</del>   
- Tests

- <del>Backend / data layer</del>
-  UI menus / logic

- <del>User authentication </del>
- Sharing map as a generated image / public webview / passcode-protected webview  

Stretch: 

Attach user images to marker info to add ability for user to easily ascribe images to a location on a static map
