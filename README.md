## Todo:  

- <del>Import custom image for map from gallery or URL
-Adding custom location marker overlay  
  - <del>scaling / positioning markers based on map tile</del>   
- Tests

- Backend / data layer
-  UI menus / logic

- User authentication 
- Sharing map as a generated image / public webview / passcode-protected webview  

Stretch: 

Attach user images to marker info to add ability for user to easily ascribe images to a location on a static map
